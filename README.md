# nerves of darkness, an outer wilds mod concept
**outer wilds: nerves of darkness** is a scrapped idea for an outer wilds mod by the *same person* behind **outer wilds: the stranger they are**. after tsta released, i decided to make a mockup of the system using nothing but new horizons, in hopes of inspiring someone to make
this project a reality.

nerves of darkness takes place in a system of planets (in this case "blanets") orbiting a supermassive black hole, which is also sucking the life out of a nearby star. the star exploded a bit before the time loop starts, as giant stars are the ones to go out first.
as for how i wanted the mod to start, i wanted to do something with the ash twin project black hole but i haven't figured out anything that makes sense on how we can warp there.

# player goals:
- discover the system and its anomalies
- find a safe way inside the black hole
- explore every nook and cranny of an impossible civilization living at its singularity

# core concepts:
- communication via sound, utilizing the hatchling's signalscope and recorded devices that play real audio.
- navigation through dark or hard to see areas using the signalscope
- limitation of communication through reading and visualization
- decoding/translating certain sounds to match with a meaning

# planets:
- purple partition: intact for the first 10 minutes of the loop, until the black hole reaches a certain height and causes the top to break off and slowly get swallowed into the black hole. this will hide/show puzzles depending on whether it's attached or not. it orbits only the black hole.
- maroon meadows: terrestrial planet with surprisingly no life outside of plants. the theme of this planet are plants that make sounds that may lead to puzzle solutions. it orbits both the black hole and the star.
- manic mesa: similar to ember twin on its surface, but possesses the solid core of the ash twin project. amazingly, anything inside its body can survive the extreme heat of a star, in which it plummets into about some time into the loop. it also has echoing caves that revolve around sound puzzles. it only orbits the star.
- blowing behemoth: huge gas giant with no real surface. the upward winds of the planet prevent the player from falling to the core, and the clouds can be frozen and walkable for the first 20 minutes in the loop, otherwise the radiation of the black hole would heat them down due to expansion. it orbits both the star and the black hole.
- frigid fog: the moon of blowing behemoth, which is a snowball earth-like moon. the player cannot see past the intense blizzards and fog, requiring them to rely on sound and signalscope to move around.

# time loop mechanic:
- the black hole gets bigger every loop
- 10 minutes in, it finishes eating the other star or supernovas. whichever looks cooler i don't mind.
- 12 minutes in, purple partition splits in half
- as time goes on, the black hole gets bigger and swallows each planet as the loop goes on. the time limit on the loop doesn't matter, but nothing below 22 mins.

# new alien species:
- there is a new alien species that left tapes across the planets and mysterious buildings, and these tapes are 100% audible. they communicate and express themselves 100% by pure sound. they have five eyes and two fingers, and are completely black and shadow-like with light-up eyes. 
- these alien entities live inside the black hole at the singularity, where time passes in strange ways and the laws of the universe are different. you will encounter them in their structure when you figure out how to enter. they absolutely hate the light, and are passive until you shine a light at them. the player will have to figure this out themselves since their corridors are so dark you would need a flashlight to see. this means you can make friends with them if you utilize your knowledge of relying on sound to guide you in blind places.
- the corridors have plenty of signals to guide the player to where they need to explore. they look like hallways with metallic-looking black walls and floors.
- the species also expresses their love through music, typically in the form of symphonies and orchestras.
- their society is structured in a hivemind collectivist format, as they are naturally connected to one another in such away, just the same way black holes are connected to one another. hence the title, nerves of darkness.
- they have the ability to warp things onto the planets such as tapes to lure the player into their corridors, and the ability to see multiple universes at once. one of their rooms has a bunch of monitors showing alternate universes, such as our timeline irl, other ow mods, and things from older universes.....such as the previous universe where humans reached the eye last cycle...
- at the end, you can get the choice to have the species warp all your friends to the eye physically with you, and the new species would play their orchestra tune at the end of the universe.
- the aliens have **five eyes** to continue the trend: one eye set out a call, two eyes shut it down, three eyes sought to find it, four eyes got to see it, **and five eyes saw it all**.
- inside their black hole they can witness several timelines since all black holes are connected to one another in some way and exist outside the plane of spacetime.
- they communicate through sound, navigate through sound, and hate the light. unlike most organisms, these fellows emit sound from their palms as they have no mouth.
- their kill method if you use a flashlight on them, strangle from behind (although they teleport behind you instantly and kill you before you can even see them). because you encounter them in pure darkness, these fellows won't have too many animations except for an idle and maybe one at the eye.
- the whole idea is to figure out how to not make them kill you, which is stop using your flashlight. then you can be friendly with them.

# misc notes, from discord messages:
in my idea, i would not only have those tape players that are simply "click to play audio", but i will also have radios that require tuning to get the right message or to learn a new frequency. although my idea would have its communications be entirely done through audio with no text and minimal imagery (maybe a few symbols if needed), similar to how echoes of the eye is entirely based around images and vision and has almost no text. this mod would require voice actors if it were to be made (but it would not need the va mod as a dependency).

not all of the audio clips will be voiced. in fact, it would not really be a voice in the way we'd understand it, since it would be encrypted. the audio would have ambience, audio cues, and a distorted spoken language that you have to learn how to decode.

like one example. an audio that has the ambience of the snowball planet i mentioned before. constant wind, signaling its location. and you hear footsteps, noises that signify turning left or right. other audio cues would also exist both in the audio and on the planet to inform the player where on the planet you're walking. like at one part of the planet, the ambience changes or a sound plays. so imagine an audio version of a slide reel telling you where to find a secret

another example, this time with voice acting. let's say this fabled language is pronounced "ssarr ya puoyd" or something. it wouldn't be in any language spoken on earth. you'd have to look for clues elsewhere that use the word(s) in a context you can understand. let's say this word is a puzzle solution like "enter at the end" and each word will be given meaning by separate audio players, usually paired with a symbol or context in areas relating to player actions, the environment around them, etc. like you hear a sound, and you think of something when you hear it. for example, end times theme. if we hear the song, we immediately associate it with the end of the loop. think of this same idea but used for solving puzzles.

very late into the mod (which mostly takes place inside a supermassive black hole), i wanted to start putting audio clips in actual irl languages (not as puzzle solutions) to unveil some staggering lore to the player...they are not only in between realities, they found their universe's creators...humans. the ones that got to the eye last cycle.

<details>
<summary>**spoilers for hearth's neighbor 2: magistarium**</summary>
this idea (for the ending) was thought of before the release of hearth's neighbor 2 in mod jam 3, so wyrm and i kind of had the same idea in the ending of that mod and this idea.

i was thinking more of a hn2 approach without any dialogue, showing images and playing audio from our old world, including a photo of the eye in this alternate human universe, which happened to be planet nine. the lack of dialogue makes it less likely to be fanfiction-y.
</details>

the audio cues are not quiet. when i mean subtle, i don't mean really quiet. i mean like, pretty loud, but not earrapingly loud. hiding it within the audio is too evil. i would never allow such a thing to happen.

"humans created the eye" has somewhat in-game evidence although not enough to prove right, but there's nothing seemingly disproving it.
- the ow universe (although not exact) mirrors discoveries and knowledge by humanity. the irl explanation is because it is a game made by humans, but in canon, it could still hold true if humans entered the eye.
- the nomai, strangers, and hearthians represent three parts of humanity. those who embrace tradition overrun with fear, those who will sacrifice everything in the matter of progress and science, and those who enjoy the simple things in life without a care in the world. these three traits are present in humanity, one typically being a dominant one.
- there is a probe containing human images and videos in the ow system. it's the fig backer probe, but lore wise, you can say it's a probe humanity fired into the eye.
- it would tie together the different realities (mods) added to the game without conflicting them. the mod itself will then use that to say it doesn't conflict outer wilds or other mods.
- there's rumors of a hidden planet in both the ow system (the eye) and the solar system (planet nine)

but it's not our universe we live in now. here's why:
- this alternate human universe dies the same as ow's
- planet nine is confirmed and is the eye of the universe
- history allows a human to enter the eye.

it was called outer wilds nerves of darkness. black hole with planets orbiting, sound-based exploration. ok but the ship has a signalscope equipped, and it will have to revolve around the player and ship controls. instead of reading or watching reels, you listen to sounds. like some tapes left behind by a mysterious anomaly
